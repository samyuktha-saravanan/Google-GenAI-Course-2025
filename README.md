# Google-GenAI-Course-2025
This repository documents my learning journey during the 5-Day Gen AI Intensive Course hosted by Google and Kaggle.

Over the week, I explored:
- Foundation Models & Prompt Engineering
- Embeddings and Vector Stores/ Databases
- Building GenAI agents 
- Domain-specific LLMs (like SecLM and Med-PaLM)
- MLOps for GenAI using Vertex AI

More details about the course can be found [here](https://rsvp.withgoogle.com/events/google-generative-ai-intensive_2025q1).\
Also, it is now available as a self-paced Learn Guide: Access whitepapers, podcasts, code labs, & recorded live streams.\
Additionally, there is a bonus assignment for you.\
